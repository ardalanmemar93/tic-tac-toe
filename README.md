<!-- Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can take turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid and try to win by forming a line of three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game also detects when there's a draw.

Features
Start a new game with the "Start Game" button.
Replay the game after it's finished with the "Replay" button.
Alternating player turns (X and O).
Visual indication of the current player's turn and winning tiles.
How to Play
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
Players take turns clicking on an empty tile to place their mark (X or O).
The game announces the winner or declares a draw when the game ends.
Click the "Replay" button to start a new game after a result is reached.
Code Structure
The game logic is implemented in script.js.
The HTML structure of the game is defined in index.html.
Basic styling is provided in style.css.
Game Flow
When the page loads, it waits for the DOM to be ready (DOMContentLoaded) and sets up event listeners for the tiles and buttons.

Clicking the "Start Game" button hides the button, resets the game board, and allows players to click on the tiles to make their moves.

Players take turns clicking on empty tiles. The current player's mark is placed on the tile, and the board state is updated.

The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a message if a player wins. It also checks for a draw and announces it.

After the game ends, the "Replay" button becomes visible, allowing players to start a new game.

Development and Customization
You can customize this game by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed. You can change the game's appearance, add animations, or implement additional features.

Feel free to adapt the code for your specific needs and have fun playing and building upon it!
